# Movie-Recommendation-System
The main goal of this machine learning project is to build a recommendation engine that recommends movies to users. This R project is designed to understand the functioning of a recommendation system. I developed an Item Based Collaborative Filter. This helped me gain experience of implementing my R, Data Science, and Machine learning skills in a real-life project. I have used the MovieLens Dataset. That data I have used consists of 105339 ratings in the ratings.csv file, applied over 10329 movies in the movies.csv. Visualisation: Similarity in data I visualised the similarity between the users as explained in the above section as well as the similarity shared between the films. Visualisation: Most viewed movies In this section of the machine learning project, I explored the most viewed movies in the dataset. Before this, I counted the number of views in a film and organized them in a table that would group them in descending order. I visualized the total number of views of the top films as a bar plot. From the visualisation, it could be observed that 'Pulp Fiction' is the most watched film followed by 'Forrest Gump'. Visualisation: Heatmap of Movie Ratings Now, in this data science project of Recommendation system, I visualized a heatmap of the movie ratings. This heatmap will contain first 25 rows and 25 columns.
